description: A highly-configurable Pythonic static site generator.
---
Skua is a highly-configurable static site generator written in Python. Skua provides a set of routines which can be used to build static sites with ease.

Skua works mainly with markdown files, but its routines are just Python functions and can be used with the rest of the Python ecosystem.
